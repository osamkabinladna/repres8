    "Like its British counterpart, the series was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track, to mirror the look of an actual documentary. It debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and ended its nine-season run on May 16, 2013, with a two-part series finale. Its original main cast was *Steve Carell*, *Rainn Wilson*, *John Krasinski*, *Jenna Fischer*, and *B. J. Novak*. It experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Stars outside the original main cast include Ed Helms, *Rashida Jones*, *Amy Ryan*, *Mindy Kaling*, *Craig Robinson*, *James Spader*, *Ellie Kemper*, and *Catherine Tate*.\n"
